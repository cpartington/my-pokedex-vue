    <p>Do you ever struggle to remember what pokémon you&rsquo;ve already caught? Have you tried to manage a spreadsheet of your pokémon so you don&rsquo;t waste time on pokémon you don&rsquo;t need? Are there pokémon you haven&rsquo;t evolved or breeded to increase your collection?</p>

    <p class="statement">Well then this might be the website for you!</p>

    <p><span class="name">My Pokédex</span> helps you keep track of your Sword &amp; Shield Pokédex. In addition to the master list, it also includes suggestions based on what pokémon you&rsquo;ve already caught. Maybe you caught a Grubbin and forgot to evolve it to get Charjabug and Vikavolt. The suggestions page finds all of these cases. This makes completing your pokédex easier and hopefully faster.</p>

    <p>Future goals for the site include more specific suggestions and user sign-on so you can save your own pokédex.</p>
